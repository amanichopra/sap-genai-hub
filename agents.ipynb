Langchain is a leading framework for building LLM-based apps, by executing sequential actions, aka \"chains\". However, we are restricted to only created DAGs. With AI agents becoming popular, there is increased demand for interactions that involve cycles (e.g. reasoning by LLMs). Thus, Langchain released a new framework, Langgraph to allow for building cyclic graphs. We will incorporate many concepts from the previous exercises including the orchestration service from the Generative AI Hub and RAG, which was covered in the last exercise. "

This warm, comforting bowl of Pumpkin Chia Steel Cut Oats is perfect for a hearty breakfast or a nourishing snack.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\nPumpkin Chia Steel Cut Oats\\n\\nIngredients:\\n• ½ cup Bob’s Red Mill Steel Cut Oats  \\n• 1 cup water (or unsweetened almond milk for extra creaminess)  \\n• ½ cup pumpkin purée (preferably unsweetened)  \\n• 1 tablespoon chia seeds  \\n• ½ teaspoon cinnamon (adjust to taste)  \\n• ½ teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, for extra aroma)  \\n• A pinch of salt  \\n• 1–2 teaspoons maple syrup or honey (optional, for natural sweetness)  \\n• Optional topping: a dollop of raw almond butter or a sprinkle of chopped nuts/granola\\n\\nInstructions:\\n1. Prepare the Oats:  \\n\\u2003a. In a small saucepan, combine the steel cut oats, water (or almond milk), and a pinch of salt.  \\n\\u2003b. Bring to a gentle boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let simmer. Stir occasionally for even cooking and to prevent sticking.\\n\\n2. Cook the Oats:  \\n\\u2003a. Allow the oats to simmer for about 20–30 minutes (cook longer if you prefer a softer, more porridge-like texture).  \\n\\u2003b. If you plan ahead, you can also soak the oats overnight and then finish cooking them briefly in the morning to speed things up.\\n\\n3. Incorporate Pumpkin and Flavorings:  \\n\\u2003a. Once the oats have softened to your liking, stir in the pumpkin purée.  \\n\\u2003b. Mix in the cinnamon and vanilla extract. The warming spices blend beautifully with the pumpkin for a fall-inspired flavor profile.  \\n\\u2003c. Add maple syrup or honey if you desire a touch of sweetness.\\n\\n4. Finish with Chia:  \\n\\u2003a. Stir in the chia seeds. They not only boost the nutritional value but also add a pleasant texture as they soften in the warm porridge.  \\n\\u2003b. Let the mixture sit for a couple of minutes so the chia seeds can absorb some moisture and thicken the oats slightly.\\n\\n5. Serve and Enjoy:  \\n\\u2003a. Pour your pumpkin chia steel cut oats into a bowl.  \\n\\u2003b. Top with a spoonful of almond butter for creaminess or a sprinkling of chopped nuts or granola for crunch if desired.  \\n\\u2003c. Serve warm and savor the blend of hearty oats, smooth pumpkin, and nutritious chia seeds!\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\nNotes:\\n• Adjust the thickness by adding a splash more water/milk for a looser porridge or cooking a bit longer for a thicker consistency.\\n• Feel free to experiment by mixing in additional fruits such as pomegranate seeds or blueberries if you’d like extra bursts of flavor (from your previous recipes) while still making oats, pumpkin, and chia the stars of the show.\\n• This recipe is versatile; you can also make a larger batch and enjoy leftovers, which may even thicken and develop even more flavor after refrigerating overnight.\\n\\nEnjoy your nourishing bowl of Pumpkin Chia Steel Cut Oats—it’s a cozy way to start your day or provide a mid-day boost!', 'is_complete': True, 'user_email': 'choppermanster@gmail.com'}\n"
